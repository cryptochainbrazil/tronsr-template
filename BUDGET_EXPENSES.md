### Expenditure budget and technical plan by June 26th
       
- USD: 50,000 technical/maintenance 
  - Maintain testnet server up and running for the community.
  - Improve network security.
  - Active development on Tron`s git-hub (java-tron, wallet-cli, walet-web, protocol, documentation)


### Hardware capacity upgrade plan 

We plan to monitor the main server load, as well the testnet and backup servers, upgrading processor and memory as required by the network, ensuring that the server does not exceed 70% of the hardware capacity.

In the first two years, we plan to add several redundancy nodes across Brazil.
