We have been working hard to improve TRON’s ecosystem. Prioritizing development of dAPP to the network users. 



We reinvesting part of he rewards in a creation of a technical team able to disseminate the knowledge and also provide new dAPPs to the network and it’s users, with the common goal of making it grow.  Rewards and give away is also part of CryptoChain campaign on TRON’s Mainnet. Mostly we will be sharing rewards with all our voters depending on their participation stake. At the moment, our distribution system is set to 90% rewards back to the community. 

Voters also need to take in consideration our plans for the network growth. As we are investing to take TRX to another level, the accessibility and environment that we are creating allows for new applications and dAPPs, hence an appreciation of TRX value.

A set o video streams, most technical content, has already been planed in order to allow new developers to start producing for Tron’s Network. The topics includes, but not restricted to, blockchain, Trons Virtual Machine, Smart Contracts, gRPC, android apps, etc.
