During the past months, we have been actively supporting the community and developers on Tron’s slack channel. Doing our best  to create a healthy growth environment.
If elected to be part of Tron’s SR, we will be reinvesting part of the rearwards in a creation of a technical team able to disseminate the knowledge with tutorials and videos and also provide new dAPPs to the network, with the common goal of making it grow.

We have been working on partnerships to introduce TRON-TRX into a payment system established in Brazil, which will allow the use of Tron at a real out-of-network expense.

We will be constantly holding meetups to collect from the community ideas of how we can improve the system, and our team will be ready to give you the best support we need to make it happen.

Rewards program is also in CryptoChain agenda. Stay tuned for further updates.
